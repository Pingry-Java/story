Sringeri Srinivas rode off into the sunset to seek people to buy his sweet and ripe bananas. He went into a popular city and went around the streets to sell his bananas. Nobody wanted to buy his bananas. He lowered his prices to almost free, but still nobody would buy his bananas. Sringeri left this city and was riding to another town when he hit a rock and rolled into the jungle with his bananas. The monkeys loved his bananas, and they idolized him as the banana king. He loved their idolization so much that Sringeri Srinivas became the king of the apes. The apes rebelled against Sringeri and killed him because he had run out of bananas.

Second Edition ending: Sringeri didnâ€™t actually die. He acted out his death scene with a close ape friend so the others would think he is dead. He ran away with no bananas and went home to grow plums.
