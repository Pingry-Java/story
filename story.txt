Sringeri Srinivas rode off into the sunset to seek people to buy his sweet and ripe
bananas. He went into a popular city and went around the streets to sell his bananas. 
Nobody wanted to buy his bananas. He lowered his prices to almost free, but still nobody
would buy his bananas. Sringeri left this city and was riding to another town when he hit
a rock and rolled into the jungle with his bananas. The monkeys loved his bananas, and
they idolized him as the banana king. He loved their idolization so much that Sringeri
Srinivas became the king of the apes.
